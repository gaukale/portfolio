    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>For my first project as a UX Designer Apprentice at Bloc I was tasked to design a cloud storage
      application and brand that would rethink the cloud storage market by targeting the problems people face today.</p>

        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>For the final product, I designed a cloud storage platform that would allow users to create documents, upload files, folders, Images, photos, and videos. It’s different from its competitors in that it’s more personable
          and focused on backing
          up content on cloud. The product is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

        <p>I am proud of my product design and efforts for this project. Going through the design process allowed me to build upon
          what I learned in the previous skills I managed to improve on my research skills by being more thorough, become
          more cohesive with my brand.</p>

      <div class="insightsright">
        <h1>What didn’t work? What did I learn?</h1>
        <p>Every design project requires me to do something I’ve never done before so I need to learn how to do it, particularly in using design tools. In addition to building upon my skills, I also improved on my confidence.
          I believe that I have a lot to learn about visual design, structure, and layout in digital space. As technology constantly advances and updates, I can’t know everything there is to know. So all I can do is improve on what I do know, be
          resourceful and be willing to learn what I still need to know. In order to improve my skills need to analyze more sites / apps / designs on the web. I believe that with
          practice and learning these visual skills will improve.</p>
