        <p>As first major UX project,I am proud of my product design and efforts for this project. Going through the design process allowed me to build upon
          what I learned in the previous skills I managed to improve on my research skills by being more thorough, become
          more cohesive with my brand.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>After working with my mentor, I worked through many versions to come to the final iteration of DataBox.
          DataBox is different from its competitors, and soultion for backing up content on cloud.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="insightsright">
        <h1>What didn’t work? What did I learn?</h1>
        <p>Every design project requires me to do something I’ve never done before so I need to learn how to do it, particularly in using design tools. In addition to building upon my skills, I also improved on my confidence.
          I believe that I have a lot to learn about visual design, structure, and layout in digital space. As technology constantly advances and updates, I can’t know everything there is to know. So all I can do is improve on what I do know, be
          resourceful and be willing to learn what I still need to know. In order to improve my skills need to analyze more sites / apps / designs on the web. I believe that with
          practice and learning these visual skills will improve.</p>
