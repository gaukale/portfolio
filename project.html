      application and brand that would rethink the<br>cloud storage market by targeting the problems people face today.</p>

      <p class="solutioninfo">For the final product, I designed a cloud storage platform that would allow users to create documents, upload files, folders, Images, photos, and videos. It’s different from its competitors in that it’s more personable
        and focused on backing
        up content on cloud. The product is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

          tests user needed
          some guidance. It was difficult for the user to navigate through interface. Observations are recorded HERE

        <p class="points">I kicked off the logo design by creating a mental map of the word “storage”. Jotting down related words helped me think of themes that could potentially inform the logo.
          From there, I began to sketch out potential logos using a pen and paper. This was the most foreign process to me, but I really tried to let my ideas flow. I aimed to create a scalable logo that was bold, but friendly.</p>
        <img src="images/mindmap.png">
        <p class="points">Data Box which I thought perfectly captured the idea associated with backing up any type data in the cloud. Providing customizable organization and collaboration features. We genuinely care about helping users to be more
          productive and have
          peace of mind. Knowing that all their precious memories and creative projects are in a private and secure place. Our goal is to give user experience comparable to having a reliable and friendly personal assistant.</p>

            what I learned in the previous skills I managed to improve on my research skills by being more thorough, become

          <h1 class="title">What didn’t work? What did I learn?</h1>
          <p class="points">Every design project requires me to do something I’ve never done before so I need to learn how to do it, particularly in using design tools. In addition to building upon my skills, I also improved on my confidence.
            I believe that I have a lot to learn about visual design, structure, and layout in digital space. As technology constantly advances and updates, I can’t know everything there is to know. So all I can do is improve on what I do know, be
            resourceful and be willing to learn what I still need to know. In order to improve my skills need to analyze more sites / apps / designs on the web. I believe that with
            practice and learning these visual skills will improve.</p>
