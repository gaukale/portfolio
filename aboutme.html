      <h1>A Little More About Me</h1>
      <p class="points">My name is Gauri. I currently live in Foster city CA.
        I was born and raised in India, which is known for its culture, yoga and Turmeric.
        Creative pursuits have been a part of my life at an early age. Since my childhood I have been the person who loved to participate in dramas,
        drawing competitions, school dances. I loved all types of art forms. So, going to art school came naturally to me.<br><br>
        Design has a profound impact on me, and so does in everyone's daily lives, yet we rarely think about it.
        For example books that we read, phone in our hand, website that we browse. All of these items have made by creative minds.
        Design is a one thing that encourages me to explore and experiment. By being able to tune into my creative nature
        I can see things from a slightly different perspective. I strive to create designs that are simple yet impactful, provoking and delightful.<br><br>
        Through research into the target audiences your business is serving, I can help to identify the needs of your prospects and clients,
        then resync that with your value proposition. By developing branded aesthetics and the right product strategy, your end-user will
        then enjoy the best possible user experience by helping your users connect to your product emotionally.
        If you’re building a digital product or service, you should talk to me. You’ll be glad you did.
        If you share a similar enthusiasm, please reach out. I'd love to talk.</p>
